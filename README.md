- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, Joblib
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- pip (Python package manager)
- Virtual environment (recommended)

## 🚀 Installation



1. **Create and activate virtual environment (recommended)**

```bash
# Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Set up the dataset and model**

- Place the Telco Customer Churn dataset (`WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv`) in the `churn_prediction_project/data` directory
- Either train a model using the provided Jupyter notebook or place a pre-trained model in `churn_prediction_project/models/model.pkl`

4. **Run migrations**

```bash
cd churn_prediction_project
python manage.py migrate
```

5. **Run the server**

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

6. **Access the application**

Open your browser and navigate to: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`

## 📊 Usage

1. **Home Page**: Overview of the churn prediction platform
2. **Dashboard**: View churn analytics and visualizations
3. **Prediction Form**: Enter customer information to predict churn:
   - Fill in demographic details (gender, senior citizen status, etc.)
   - Provide account information (tenure, contract type, etc.)
   - Input service details (phone service, internet service, etc.)
   - Add billing information (payment method, charges, etc.)
4. **Results Page**: View the prediction result with probability and customer profile summary

## 🔧 Customization

- **Model**: Replace the model.pkl file with your own trained model
- **Dataset**: Use your own customer dataset (ensure column names match)
- **UI**: Modify the templates and CSS to change the appearance
- **Features**: Extend the project by adding more visualizations or analysis tools

## 📈 Model Training

The machine learning model was trained using:
- Random Forest Classifier
- Features include customer demographics, services subscribed, and billing information
- Target variable is customer churn (Yes/No)

For retraining the model:
1. Use the provided Jupyter notebook or create your own training script
2. Save the model using joblib to the models directory
3. Make sure feature names match those expected by the prediction form
